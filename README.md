# Snake Game

## Description
The classic Snake game developed using the `pygame` library. The player controls a snake, aiming to eat food. As the snake consumes food, it grows in length. The game concludes if the snake collides with the screen boundary or itself.

## Game Mechanics (From Code Review)
- The game screen has dimensions of 640x480 pixels.
- The snake moves in a grid pattern, with each segment being 10x10 pixels.
- Food is randomly positioned on the screen, and when the snake consumes it, a new piece of food is spawned.

## Installation and Setup
To set up and run the Snake game:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the game using the command:
```
python snake.py
```

## Usage
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to guide the snake. Aim to eat the food pieces while avoiding collisions with the screen edges and the snake's body.

## Code Structure (From Code Review)
- `display_snake`: Function to display the snake on the screen.
